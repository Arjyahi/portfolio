                <h3> Machine Learning Engineer (Capstone)</h3>
                <h4> Medtronic | September 2025 - Present</h4>
                <p>As part of my graduate Capstone project, I am collaborating with Medtronic to design a generative AI tool that automates PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) document assembly. Working in a cross-functional team, I contribute to system design, data pipelines, and integration of LLM-driven document generation workflows. The project combines NLP, structured document parsing, and prompt engineering with an emphasis on compliance, reliability, and user-friendly interfaces. On the computer vision side, I apply OpenCV and OCR to auto-balloon engineering drawings, extract dimensional tolerances, and map them to inspection forms. Beyond technical implementation, I also help align requirements, documentation standards, and reproducibility with industry compliance needs, ensuring a solution that is reliable, interpretable, and user-friendly.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, NLP, CV, OpenCV, Generative AI</p>

                <h4>University of Colorado Boulder | June 2025 - July 2025</h4>
                <p>As a Data Science Intern, I designed and deployed end-to-end data workflows to optimize parking operations across 50+ zones. I built scalable ML-ready pipelines in Python to integrate GPS data with officer shift logs, enabling advanced time-series features and anomaly detection. I also developed spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to uncover patrol inefficiencies and reduce false positives in anomaly reports. To support decision-making, I created sub-5s latency dashboards in Power BI/DAX and integrated schema-standardized XML reports into the AIMS Parking System, ensuring reliable KPI monitoring and ML-ready datasets across multiple units.</p>
