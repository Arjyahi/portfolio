                <h3> Machine Learning Engineer (Capstone)</h3>
                <h4> Medtronic| September 2025 - Present</h4>
                <p>As part of my graduate Capstone project, I am collaborating with Medtronic to design a generative AI tool that automates the assembly of PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) documents. Working in a cross-functional student team, I am contributing to system design, data pipeline creation, and integration of LLM-driven document generation workflows. The project combines NLP, structured document parsing, and prompt engineering with an emphasis on compliance, reliability, and user-friendly interfaces. Beyond technical implementation, I also coordinate with stakeholders on requirements, documentation standards, and reproducibility, aligning our solution with real-world industry needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, NLP, CV, OpenCV, Generative AI</p>

                <h3> Student Ambassador - Department of Computer Science</h3>
                <h4>University of Colorado Boulder| July 2025 - Present</h4>
                <p>As a Data Science Intern, I designed and deployed end-to-end data workflows to optimize parking operations across 50+ zones. I built scalable ML-ready pipelines in Python to integrate GPS data with officer shift logs, enabling advanced time-series features and anomaly detection. I also developed spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to uncover patrol inefficiencies and reduce false positives in anomaly reports. To support decision-making, I created sub-5s latency dashboards in Power BI/DAX and integrated schema-standardized XML reports into the AIMS Parking System, ensuring reliable KPI monitoring and ML-ready datasets across multiple units.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Excel, SQL, Data Analysis</p>

                    <p>At Excelerate, I led the design and automation of ML and analytics pipelines that powered large-scale student recruitment insights. I engineered feature pipelines in Python and PostgreSQL to streamline dataset preparation, and built predictive models (logistic regression, decision trees) that achieved strong AUC/recall performance and were tied to a measured 25% increase in applications during pilot campaigns. I also drove marketing optimization through A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and causal inference, identifying high-performing audience segments with statistically significant CTR lifts. Additionally, I scaled data infrastructure to process over 1M records across engagement, demographic, and financial dimensions, while mentoring 300+ interns on applied ML and analytics best practices to ensure reproducibility and rigor.</p>
